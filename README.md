Spot Check #1
---------------

Explanation: The Purpose of this spot check is to determine if your team is on track and has started the summative. This is covered as part of the 15% planning phase of the summative. In this spot check I am assessing a 5% portion of this phase. You still have a further 10% to consider for the remaining check at the end. The following aspects are being assessed; they should be started and/or completed at the beginning of the summative:
